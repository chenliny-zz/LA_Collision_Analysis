### Project Context
The World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Department of Transportation statistics show that approximately 1.35 million people in the world or more than 35,000 people in the U.S. lost their lives due to traffic collisions each year. In Los Angeles alone, more than 200 people were killed each year while trying to move around throughout the city. Bikers, pedestrians, children, and older adults were particularly vulnerable on the cityâ€™s streets. However, traffic deaths are predictable and preventable, and everyone has the right to move safely in their communities. Thus, the City of Los Angeles has committed to the Vision Zero initiative, aiming to eliminate all traffic deaths and series injuries by 2025. In order to achieve the grand vision of Vision Zero, we first need to understand our existing collisions better. Thanks to the California Highway Patrol (CHP), we have data for all reported traffic collisions in the City of Los Angeles from 2009 to 2018. This project includes an exploratory analysis on traffic collisions in the City of Los Angeles, aiming to answer questions such as:
- when and where do collisions happen?
- what are their risk factors?
- who are the victims?
- where are the severe collision clusters (dangerous intersections)?
- ...
